Given a string, S, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line.

CODE:
N=int(input())
for i in range (0, N):
    str=input()                    #to take N number of strings as an input
    print(str[0::2],str[1::2])     # str[0::2] separates the characher at the position starting from 0 by the number specified beside :: (in short even positioned characters) 
                                   # str [1:2] separates the odd positioned character as it is starting from odd index
