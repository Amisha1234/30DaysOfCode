Given n names and phone numbers, assemble a phone book that maps friends' names to their respective phone numbers.
You will then be given an unknown number of names to query your phone book for. 
For each name queried, print the associated entry from your phone book on a new line in the form name=phoneNumber; if an entry for name is not found, print Not found instead.

CODE:
n=int(input())
phoneBook={}
for i in range (0,n):
    data = str(input()).split(" ")
    name= data[0]
    phoneNumber= int(data[1])
    phoneBook[name] = phoneNumber

#for loop doesn't work for large number of input and throws error so instead of for loop use while loop
#while loop without try except gives "enf of file error" so use of try and except is must

try:
    while (True):                              
        name=str(input())
        if name in phoneBook:  
            print(name+"="+str(phoneBook[name]))
        else:
            print("Not found")
except(EOFError):
            pass
