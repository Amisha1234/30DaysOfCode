Given a base- 10 integer,n, convert it to binary (base-2). Then find and print the base-10 integer denoting the maximum 
number of consecutive 1's in n's binary representation. When working with different bases, it is common to show the base as a subscript.

CODE:
n=int(input())
b=bin(n).replace("0b","")

#b.split('0') splits the value of b by separating 1's and 0's

print(max(map(len, b.split('0')))) 


INPUT:
13

OUTPUT:
2
