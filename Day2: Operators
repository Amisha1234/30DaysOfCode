Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), 
and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, 
find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer.

CODE:

# Complete the solve function below.
def solve(meal_cost, tip_percent, tax_percent):
    tip=((tip_percent*meal_cost)/100)
    tax=((tax_percent*meal_cost)/100)
    total_cost=round(tip+tax+meal_cost)
    return (total_cost)

meal_cost = float(input())
tip_percent = int(input())
tax_percent = int(input())
print(solve(meal_cost, tip_percent, tax_percent))
